## Introduction

Imagine a tool that takes the hassle out of creating your university timetable â€“ that's exactly what the UBCTimeTableScheduler does for UBC students. Gone are the days of painstakingly checking course timings and manually trying to resolve clashing schedules. With this innovative tool, you're just a few clicks away from a perfect timetable tailored to your needs.

### How It Works

1. **Input Your Courses**: Start by entering the courses you plan to enroll in. Whether it's a required major course or an elective, the scheduler accommodates them all.
2. **Prioritize Your Preferences**: Do you prefer morning classes or are you more of an afternoon person? With UBCTimeTableScheduler, you can set your preferences for class times.
3. **Let the Magic Happen**: Once your courses and preferences are in, the scheduler works its magic. Using advanced algorithms, it automatically generates a timetable that fits your courses without any time overlaps.
